# Design Pattern Library Loader
A simple PHP-driven pattern library loader.

## Getting Started
1. Rename the parameters in the `project.json` file to match your project. This is optional but makes thing a little more presentable and personalized
2. Create your individual Scss files in the `/assets/scss` directory
3. To automate things and save time, James wrote a Bash script that will generate your pattern HTML files based on the names of your Scss files. Run `genpattern` via Terminal to do the job:<br/>
`$ ./genpattern`
4. Start writing your design pattern HTML in the files generated in step 3
3. To display your patterns, open `index.php` in your web browser
